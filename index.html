            <h2>Goal 1: No Poverty</h2>
            <p>End poverty in all its forms everywhere.</p>
            <p>Poverty is more than the lack of income and resources to ensure a sustainable livelihood. Its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion, as well as the lack of participation in decision-making. Economic growth must be inclusive to provide sustainable jobs and promote equality.</p>

            <h2>Goal 2: Zero Hunger</h2>
            <p>End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.</p>
            <p>It is time to rethink how we grow, share and consume our food. If done right, agriculture, forestry and fisheries can provide nutritious food for all and generate decent incomes, while supporting people-centered rural development and protecting the environment. Right now, our soils, freshwater, oceans, forests, and biodiversity are being rapidly degraded. Climate change is putting even more pressure on the resources we depend on, increasing risks associated with disasters such as droughts and floods.</p>

            <h2>Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being</h2>
            <p>Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</p>
            <p>Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages is essential to sustainable development. Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality. Major progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation, reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio, and the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, more efforts are needed to fully eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and emerging health issues.</p>

            <h2>Goal 4: Quality Education</h2>
            <p>Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.</p>
            <p>Obtaining a quality education is the foundation to improving people’s lives and sustainable development. Major progress has been made towards increasing access to education at all levels and increasing enrollment rates in schools particularly for women and girls. Basic literacy skills have improved tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to make even greater strides for achieving universal education goals. For example, the world has achieved equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have achieved that target at all levels of education.</p>

            <h2>Goal 5: Gender Equality</h2>
            <p>Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.</p>
            <p>While the world has achieved progress towards gender equality and women’s empowerment under the Millennium Development Goals (including equal access to primary education between girls and boys), women and girls continue to suffer discrimination and violence in every part of the world. Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world. Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large.</p>

            <h2>Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</h2>
            <p>Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.</p>
            <p>Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world, an alarming figure that is projected to increase with the rise of global temperatures as a consequence of climate change. Although 2.1 billion people have improved water sanitation since 1990, dwindling drinking water supplies are affecting every continent. In 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress; ten of them are close to depleting their renewable freshwater sources and must now rely on alternative water sources.</p>

            <h2>Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy</h2>
            <p>Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.</p>
            <p>Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Whether it is for jobs, security, climate change, food production, or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. Transitioning the world to sustainable energy is also crucial for creating a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future. As the population continues to grow, so will the demand for cheap energy, and an economy reliant on fossil fuels is creating drastic changes to our climate. Investing in solar, wind, and thermal power, improving energy productivity, and ensuring energy for all is vital.</p>

            <img src="GOAL8LOGO.gif" alt="Goal 8 Logo"class="goal-pic">
            <h2>Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</h2>
            <p>Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.</p>
            <p>Roughly half the world’s population still lives on the equivalent of about US$2 a day. And in many places, having a job doesn’t guarantee the ability to escape from poverty. This slow and uneven progress requires us to rethink and retool our economic and social policies aimed at eradicating poverty. A continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments, and under-consumption contribute to the erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress. Sustainable economic growth will require societies to create the conditions that allow people to have quality jobs that stimulate the economy while not harming the environment.</p>

        <section id="goal9-text" class="goal-text">
            <img src="GOAL9LOGO.gif" alt="Goal 9 Logo"class="goal-pic">
            <h2>Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation.</p>
            <p>Inclusive and sustainable industrial development is the primary source of income generation, allowing for rapid and sustained increases in living standards for all people, and providing the technological solutions needed for environmentally sound industrialization. Without technology and innovation, industrialization will not happen, and without industrialization, development will not happen. It has long been recognized that a strong physical infrastructure—roads, information and communication technologies, sanitation, electrical power, and water—is essential for industrial development and inclusive growth.</p>

        <section id="goal10-text" class="goal-text">
            <img src="GOAL10LOGO.gif" alt="Goal 10 Logo"class="goal-pic">
            <h2>Goal 10: Reduced Inequality</h2>
            <p>Reduce inequality within and among countries.</p>
            <p>It is well documented that income inequality is on the rise, with the richest 10 percent earning up to 40 percent of total global income. The poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 and 7 percent of total global income. In developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent if we consider the growth of population. Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction, and destroys people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth. There is growing consensus that economic growth is not sufficient to reduce poverty if it is not inclusive and if it does not involve the three dimensions of sustainable development—economic, social, and environmental.</p>

            <h2>Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h2>
            <p>Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.</p>
            <p>The challenges cities face are well known. Cities are hubs for ideas, commerce, culture, science, productivity, social development, and much more. At their best, cities have enabled people to advance socially and economically. However, many challenges exist to maintaining cities in a way that continues to create jobs and prosperity while not straining land and resources. Common urban challenges include congestion, lack of funds to provide basic services, a shortage of adequate housing, and declining infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</h2>
            <p>Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.</p>
            <p>Sustainable consumption and production are about promoting resource and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to basic services, green and decent jobs, and a better quality of life for all. Its implementation helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce future economic, environmental, and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness, and reduce poverty. There is a clear need for a more systematic approach and cooperation among actors operating in the supply chain, from producer to final consumer.</p>

            <h2>Goal 13: Climate Action</h2>
            <p>Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.</p>
            <p>Climate change is a global challenge that affects everyone, everywhere. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are driving climate change and continue to rise. They are now at their highest levels in history. Global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system, which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not act. The annual average economic losses from climate-related disasters are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. This is not to mention the human impact of geophysical disasters, which are 91 percent climate-related and accounted for 6 percent of all disasters.</p>

            <h2>Goal 14: Life Below Water</h2>
            <p>Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.</p>
            <p>The world’s oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents, and life – drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe are ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. Throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital conduits for trade and transportation. Careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future. However, there is a continuous deterioration of coastal waters owing to pollution, and ocean acidification is having an adversarial effect on the functioning of ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>Goal 15: Life on Land</h2>
            <p>Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.</p>
            <p>Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth’s surface and, in addition to providing food security and shelter, forests are key to combating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and the homes of the indigenous population. Thirteen million hectares of forests are lost each year, while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares, disproportionately affecting poor communities. Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity, which are part of our common heritage and support global food and water security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and peace and security.</p>

            <h2>Goal 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions</h2>
            <p>Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.</p>
            <p>We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace, stability, human rights, and effective governance based on the rule of law. Yet, our world is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy peace, security, and prosperity, while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is not inevitable and must be addressed. High levels of armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development, affecting economic growth, and often resulting in long-standing grievances among communities that can last for generations.

            <h2>Goal 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal</h2>
            <p>Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.</p>
            <p>A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society. These inclusive partnerships built upon principles and values, a shared vision, and shared goals that place people and the planet at the center are needed at the global, regional, national, and local levels. Urgent and bold actions are needed to ensure that we meet the Sustainable Development Goals. To achieve this, we must mobilize, redirect, and unlock the transformative power of trillions of dollars of private resources to deliver on sustainable development objectives. Long-term investments are needed in critical sectors, especially in developing countries.</p>
